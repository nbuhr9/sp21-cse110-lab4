## Part 1a
1. values added: 20
2. final result: 20
3. values added: 20
4. error; result was defined out-of-scope (within the nested if-statement with the 'let' keyword) so the compiler treats it as undefined.
5. error; result was declared with the 'const' keyword, so the compiler complains when we try to reassign its value in line 7.
6. error; same reasoning as for number 5
