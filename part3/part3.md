1. The code in part1 reads in input as a string and stores that in num1/num2, then ends up returning the concatenation of num1 and num2.

2. I would fix this by simply parsing the input for its numerical value, with either parseInt() (as shown in the screenshot labeled bug-fix) or parseFloat(), depending on whether we only plan to accept integer inputs or real numbers.
